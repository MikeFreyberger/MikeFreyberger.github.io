I am currently the Co-Founder & CTO of Scope3, an advertising sustainability platform where I've helped build the first-ever carbon emissions model for digital advertising. Previously, I was a founding engineer at Waybridge (commodities trading platform) and a senior software engineer at AppNexus, where I worked on their ad server and streaming data pipeline.

I live in New Jersey with my family and have 4 kids. I absolutely love being a dad and playing with my kids.

Princeton Electrical Engineering class of 2016.
