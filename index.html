                <h4>Exploring the limitations in Web Privacy</h4>
                <p>In web settings it is very difficult to assure the user their data is kept private. Recent work has been developed to create a browser extension that can make text based web applications private without trusting any part of the application itself. The name of this project is ShadowCrypt and is available in the Chrome Extension store. This extension fails to address certain attacks that will be proposed here. These attacks will allow for web applications to add certain Javascript code to their sites in order to prevent ShadowCrypt from working as the user would expect. Some of these attacks can be patched with updates to ShadowCrypt; however, there are also fundamental attacks that exploit the lack of isolation between the shadow DOM and the normal DOM.</p>

However, if the attacker gains access to a device that is already authenticated, the attacker can launch an impersonation attack which threatens the victim and the other users in his network.</p>

                <p>Tor, the onion router, is an anonymity system that allows for privacy and decreased censorship during web browsing. However, there are a few attacks that can still mitigate the increase in privacy that Tor provides. One of the most popular attacks is a timing analysis attack. This attack can take place when there are two attackers, one eavesdropping the victim client and one eavesdropping the victim server. Both of the eavesdroppers work together to determine correlations between the packet traces in order to determine if the client is communicating with the server. Interesting research has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of application level defenses. This paper is interested in determining if there are possible innovations within the physical layer that can protect Tor against the timing analysis attack. Most specifically, this paper will investigate how the Tor system can be assisted by the use of Steganography.</p>

                <h4>Zero-Delay Distortion-Inducing Secure Source Coding</h4>
                <p>In order to communicate in a secure manner, there must be a method of making the communication system confidential. Confidentiality is typically achieved via a method of encryption. There are methods of using symmetric and asymmetric keys in order to make the system confidential. However, using asymmetric encryption is very slow, and maintaining symmetric keys can often be difficult. Symmetric keys are typically 128 bits, and must be refreshed frequently. What if the amount of secrecy between the two parties is severely limited? In this case, an encoder must be constructed such that the eavesdropper’s probability of error, also known as the eavesdropper’s Hamming distortion, is maximized. This paper discusses how to construct an encoder that maximizes the eavesdropper’s probability of error when there is only one secret key bit. This method is then extended to study the case in which there are <i>lg|3|</i> bits of secrecy. Lastly, this paper studies how introducing a stochastic encoder can increase the eavesdropper’s probability of error, and how variable length encodings influence the proceeding results.</p>

                <p>The capstone junior ELE project requires building a robotic car. My partner and I built an omnibot that tracks Infrared LED’s. Using multiple IR LED beacons with unique signatures, the car is able to determine where it is in the room. Then, the user can inform the car where he is by communicating with the car over IP through an android application. Finally, the car is able to drive to the user by controlling it’s motion with the two IR receivers that act as eyes, and two ultrasonic pingers that allow the car to avoid obstacles on it’s left and right.</p>

                <h4>Bursting into Burst Length Countermeasures for Tor</h4>
                <p>We consider the setting where clients communicate with servers in the Tor environment for the purpose of concealing the identity of the website they are accessing. While Tor is more effective at preventing traffic analysis attacks, the websites accessed on Tor are still susceptible to attacks by top performing website classifiers such as the ones developed by Panchenko et al., and Dyer et al. These classifiers exploit coarse features in the communication trace, most importantly the ordering of the packets. While countermeasures at the packet level cannot sufficiently defend against these attacks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of applying countermeasures that mask the bursts in the data by sending strategically placed dummy packets. In this paper, we propose and experiment with eleven novel burst-level countermeasures that provided varying tradeoffs between accuracy and byte level overhead. The countermeasures that most significantly reduce classifier accuracy require slightly more than 100% byte level overhead. Our findings imply that, with strategic placement of dummy packets, traffic analysis countermeasures can provide more desirable web security and anonymity. </p>
