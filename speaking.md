In this talk I present the work I did as part of my senior thesis, which was published in the 2018 journal of Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS).
My research focused on the system requirements for developing a mechanism for secure input and output within Internet browsers.
My main contribution was a successful attack against [ShadowCrypt](http://devd.me/papers/shadowcrypt-ccs14.pdf), a technology trying to provide secure I/O in browsers via a browser extension.
