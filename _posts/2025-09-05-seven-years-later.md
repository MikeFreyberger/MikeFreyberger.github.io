Wow, the past 7 years have been crazy. I had 4 kids, I helped start 2 startups, and I never posted anything here.

I probably won't necessarily start posting here regularly, but hopefully I can find a link to some of the talks I gave in the past couple of years at Scope3. I've spoken at Prebid, Beeler.Tech and Jounce.

I came here to post my updated resume in case someone stumbles upon this page.
